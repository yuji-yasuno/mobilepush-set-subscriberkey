/**
 ETMessage is the local representation of a Message from Salesforce. They are multipurpose, sometimes representing a message that should be scheduled because of the entrance or exit of a Geofence, the proximal arrival to an iBeacon, or a CloudPage message downloaded from ET. Because of their multipurpose nature, there are a lot of different attributes on them, many of which may be null at any give time depending on the type of message.
 
 ETMessages also feature Message Limiting, a system of preventing a given message from firing too often. If described in a sentence with the parameters interlaced, it would read "show this message only 1 (messagesPerPeriod) time per 1 (numberOfPeriods) hour (periodType). As of a recent release, messagesPerPeriod will be defaulted to 1 on the Middle Tier, so if it is null or absent, we assume 1, otherwise take the given value.
 
 Many of these accessors are readonly because the value should be trusted and not changed. There are specific methods to modify the message, such as markAsRead or markAsDeleted. Also, unless specifically marked in a method, only active methods are returned through the getter methods.
